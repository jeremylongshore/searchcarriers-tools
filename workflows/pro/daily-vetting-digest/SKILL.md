# Carrier Review Queue Digest

Carrier Review Queue Digest helps an operator turn supplied or fetched qualification results into a prioritized human review queue. It solves this operational failure: Daily summaries become misleading when they collapse missing evidence into passes or imply email delivery occurred.

## Overview

The workflow is **identify → fetch → reconcile → decide → act**. API data is
licensed research evidence, not an endorsement, official safety rating, or guarantee.
Keep the human or named company policy as the decision owner.

The bounded result is: Return DIGEST READY or INCOMPLETE with counts that reconcile to detail rows.

## Prerequisites

- Set `SEARCHCARRIERS_API_KEY` to a SearchCarriers bearer token with the required tier.
- Confirm the subject identifier, intended movement or decision, and named policy when applicable.
- Read [`API-DISCOVERY.md`](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/searchcarriers-tools/blob/main/API-DISCOVERY.md) with the `Read` tool before changing routes or parameters.
- Use `Bash(curl:*)` for API requests and `Bash(python:*)` only for local JSON validation or deterministic reshaping.

Authentication is `Authorization: Bearer $SEARCHCARRIERS_API_KEY`; never print,
commit, or place the token in a URL. Do not commit live API responses.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Define the decision

Write one sentence naming the subject, the operational use, the evidence window,
and who owns the final decision. If a policy threshold is required, obtain the
named policy instead of inventing an “industry standard.”

### Step 2: Resolve identity

Prefer USDOT or docket identifiers. Treat name-only matches as ambiguous until
legal name, location, and identifiers agree. Stop on conflicting identity.

### Step 3: Fetch the smallest evidence set

**Routes/tools:** GET /api/v2/company/{dot}/qualification-reports; Ops Reporter output

Collect named qualification results, preserve per-carrier evidence and as-of, group Fail before Review before Pass, and generate a digest artifact without claiming delivery.

For a direct API request, use the documented route and selected fields:

```bash
curl --fail-with-body --get   "https://searchcarriers.com/api/v3/company/$DOT_NUMBER"   --header "Authorization: Bearer $SEARCHCARRIERS_API_KEY"   --header "Accept: application/json"   --data-urlencode "fields=contact,authorities,insurance,safety,operation,risk_factors"
```

Use the specialty v1 or qualification v2 route listed above when the job requires
it; never rewrite every route to the highest version.

### Step 4: Reconcile evidence

Capture: Qualification name, carrier, verdict, reasons, missing evidence, as-of, owner, and next action.

Keep facts, policy tests, modeled indicators, and analyst judgment in separate
fields. Preserve zeros; represent absent fields as `unknown` with a reason.

### Step 5: Decide and prescribe the next action

Return DIGEST READY or INCOMPLETE with counts that reconcile to detail rows.

**Next action:** Assign Fail and Review items, then send through an explicitly configured delivery system.

## Output

Return this compact decision record:

```yaml
subject: "DOT or input identifier"
purpose: "the exact operational question"
status: "bounded status from this skill"
evidence:
  - fact: "observed value"
    source: "API route or MCP tool"
    as_of: "timestamp or source date"
missing_evidence: []
policy_or_method: "named policy, evidence-only, or disclosed model"
next_action: "owner and concrete action"
limitations: "coverage, freshness, and inference limits"
```

Every material claim needs a source and as-of value. Totals must reconcile to
detail rows. The output must say whether any result is partial.

## Examples

**Should trigger:** “Build today’s refrigerated-policy carrier review digest.”

Produce the bounded record, show the decisive evidence and unknowns, and give one
operational next action.

**Should not trigger:** “Search for one carrier by SCAC.”

Route that request to the narrower SearchCarriers skill whose job matches it.

## Error Handling

| Condition | Required response |
|---|---|
| Identity conflict or multiple matches | Stop and return `REVIEW`; request a USDOT or docket. |
| Missing field or empty data | Unavailable results remain unresolved and are excluded from pass counts. |
| `401` | Stop; report invalid/missing credentials without exposing them. |
| `403` | Stop; identify the route and required plan/access. |
| `404` | Recheck the identifier and route; do not treat it as adverse carrier evidence. |
| `422` | Remove unsupported parameters and compare with the API contract. |
| `429` | Honor `Retry-After`; use bounded retry and preserve progress. |
| `5xx` or timeout | Retry with bounded backoff, then return partial/unavailable. |
